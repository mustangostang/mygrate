Todo:

[ ] Merge behaviour (specs?)
[ ] Block updates if there are uncommited changes (proceed with care, requires
    extensive testing).

> [ ] Separate logic of revisions/migrations (? why: current model works
    well enough)
    
[ ] Implement include-data command, adding data info to migration.
[ ] Non-invasive roll-back and roll-forward in order to support migration
    injections.
* [ ] Ignore command: ignore some tables.
    Syntax: ignore [-r] table

Done:

[x] Support for shortcuts (ci for commit, up for update etc.)
[x] Closer integration with Mercurial. Option to select VCS on init.
    Auto add .conf files on commit.
[x] Implement status command (A, R, M, M+, M-)
[x] Implement tip command (displays info for current revision)
[x] Implement log command (displays detailed revision info)
[x] We should save history of current branch, in order to track actual 
    migration files.
