Todo:

[ ] Merge behaviour (specs?)

> [ ] Separate logic of revisions/migrations (we should store migrations so one
      can do some changes to them by hand. Revisions are for inner integrity checks.
      Before actually doing any operations we should check if migrations are in
      sync with our revision history)
    
[ ] Implement include-data command, adding data info to migration.
[ ] Non-invasive roll-back and roll-forward in order to support migration
    injections.
* [ ] Ignore command: ignore some tables.
    Syntax: ignore [-r] table

[reopened] We should save history of current branch, in order to track actual 
    migration files. 
[ ] Commits should open another point in revision history, yes!


Done:

[x] Support for shortcuts (ci for commit, up for update etc.)
[x] Closer integration with Mercurial. Option to select VCS on init.
    Auto add .conf files on commit.
[x] Implement status command (A, R, M, M+, M-)
[x] Implement tip command (displays info for current revision)
[x] Implement log command (displays detailed revision info)
[x] Block updates if there are uncommited changes (proceed with care, requires
    extensive testing).
